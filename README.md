# Code Wars Challenges

A single repository for all the Code Wars Challenges I have completed. I am hoping to complete a challenge a day in hopes to gradually sharpen my skills.   

Folders are based on difficulty of challenge with 8kyu being the easiest challenges and 1kyu being the most difficult.  

Within the difficulty folders, each challenge will have its own folder with two files inside.  
`task.md: A file which explains the challenge`  
`main.js: A file that contains the solution to the challenge`
